DB22505 and DB22506 excluded PO3

DB22507 So the first 3 PDB residues match the first 3 shift residues in this molecule.

a-D-Galp was missing the PDB, added it

DB26370 is another phosphorous one where the PO3 groups in the PDB can
be skipped, and then the residue order (but not absolute number)
matches between PDB and shift.

DB26378  is another phosphorous one where the PO3 groups in the PDB can

DB26379 is another phosphorous one where the PO3 groups in the PDB can

DB26380 is another phosphorous one where the PO3 groups in the PDB

DB26378 the shift order matches the residue number order in the PDB if
PO3 is removed

DB26403 the shift order matches the residue number order in the PDB if
PO3 is removed

DB26404 the shift order matches the residue number order in the PDB if
PO3 is removed

DB26405 the shift order matches the residue number order in the PDB if
PO3 is removed---But one note the PO3 atoms needs to be in the graph

DB26431  the shift order matches the residue number order in the PDB
if PO3 is removed, but Hepp is another name for MAN in bacteria
(Man-hepp).

DB26467  the shift order matches the residue number order in the PDB
if PO3 is removed,

DB26476 the shift order matches the residue number order in the PDB,
but the second last residue is missing all but 1 and 5 carbons /
hydrogens.

DB26479  the shift order matches the residue number order in the PDB,
but ME has to be removed from the shifts as it is a functional group
not carbohydrate residue.

NeuAca2-3Galb1-3( NeuAca2-3Galb1-4GlcNAc b1-6)GalNAc can be corrected
by SWECOM but it's more complicated than others.

DB26511  the shift order should match the residue number order in the
PDB if it follows the template of the molecules uploaded around the
same time, some ambiguity but consistent overall

DB26521 is another phosphorous one where the PO3 group in the PDB can
be skipped (last residue), and then the residue order (but not absolute number)
matches between PDB and shift. The quip4n is equivalent to
deoxy-Glcp4n in nomenclature

DB4762 can be used, but PDB residue 5 -> csv shift residue 6, and 6 ->
5 respectively.

DB4858 can be used, residue 5 in the PDB is residue 3 in the shift
file. Residue 3 and 4 in the PDB are residues 4 and 5 in the shift
file. 1 and 2 match.

DB8939 can be used, residue 5 in the PDB is residue 3 in the shift

DB9023 can be used, but residue 3 ->4 and 4-> 3 between the PDB and shift csv..

DB9078 can be used but residue 5 ->6 and 6-> 5 between the PDB and
shift csv. Other residues have the csv order match the PDB order

DB9188 can be used but residue 3->4and 4-> 3between the PDB and

DB9490 can be used but residue 3 ->4 and 4-> 3 between the PDB and

DB9507 can be used, residue 5 in the PDB is residue 3 in the shift

DB9697can be used but residue 3 ->4 and 4-> 3 between the PDB and

DB9708 can be used but residue 4 ->5 and 5-> 4 between the PDB and

DB9917 can be used but 5, 4, 3 in the PDB map to 3, 4, 5 in the csv
(so 1,2,4 match but 3 and 5 flipped).

DB9919 can be used but residue 5 ->6 and 6-> 5 between the PDB and

DB9948 can be used, residue 5 in the shift is residue 3 in the pdb
file. Residue 3 and 4 in the shift are residues 4 and 5 in the pdb. 1
and 2 match.

DB9949 can be used, residue 5 in the shift is residue 3 in the pdb

DB26715 pdb order matches shift order, but last PDB residue is PO3
(shouldn't affect shifts).

DB26722 pdb order matches shift order, there are two PO3 groups but
they are the last PDB residues.

DB26881 pdb order matches shift order, but one PO3 group needs to be
ignored in the residue order counting in the PDB (not in shift)

DB26907 the relative PDB and shift order matches. But residue 2 and 7
in the PDB should be skipped in matching (CSC and PO3), and the first
choline residue in the shifts should be skipped since these aren't
carbohydrates.

In DB26908, res 5 is actually res 1 in the PDB, and all other res need
+1 added to them (e.g. 1 -> 2 ). Then Choline needs to be ignored in
the shift, the one at the top of the shift, it's not a residue. The
high C numbers in the PDB correspond to Choline like C8, C9, C10, C11
etc. Just fit the C's in the shift list.

DB26909 relative residue order matches PDB and csv, but residue 2 and
7 need to be ignored in the PDB for shift matching since they are PO3
and CSC.

DB26910 relative residue order matches PDB and csv, but residue 3 and
6, and 7 need to be ignored in the PDB for shift matching since they are PO3

DB26960 there are two residues, and the PDB order is flipped. 1->2,
2->1 needs to be done in the PDB.

I just replaced DB8939.csv, it had a formatting issue

DB9155.pdb was missing and added, DB9155.csv already there

b-D-Manp has two different C6 shifts actually, C6 should possibly be
omitted for this glycan:

DB26510 was missing, added it (meaning the PDB of 26510 was missing in last)

a-L-Rhap-(1-4)-a-D-GalpA-(1-3)-b-D-GlcpNAc-(1-2)-a-L-Rhap-(3-1)-a-L-Rhap
has an issue, the PDB and csv is offset by 1 in order.

a-D-GlcpA-(1-2)-a-D-GalpA-(1-2)-b-D-Manp(1-4)-b-D-Galp-(1-2)-b-D-Rhap.pdb
had an issue, replaced it

For a-D-Galp-(1-2)-a-L-Rhap-(1-3)-b-D-Manp-(1-4)-b-D-Manp-(1-4)-a-D-Galp-(1-3)-b-D-Galp-(2-1)-a-D-Glcp
, the pdb only has an error in it that needs to be corrected. Residue
1 and 2 are flipped and need to be swapped back. GLC should be 1.

b-D-Xylp-(1-4)-b-D-Xylp-(1-4)-a-L-Galp-(2-1)-b-D-Xylp the pdb only has
an error in it that needs to be corrected. Residue 1 and 2 are flipped
and need to be swapped back. GAL should be 1 not 2..

b-D-Fruf-(2-1)-b-D-Fruf-(2-1)-b-D-Fruf-(2-1)-b-D-Fruf-(2-1)-a-D-Glcp
PDB is missing too much and 1st and 2nd residue is swapped.

Corrected a-D-Manp-(1-2)-b-D-manp-(1-3)-a-D-GlcpNAc-(1-6)-a-D-Manp.pdb,
H1o should be H62. Redownload the online data

In b-D-Galf-(1-3)-b-D-GalpNAc-(1-3)-b-D-Galp-(4-1)-a-D-Glcp-(6-1)-b-D-Glcp,
the shift order matches the name. The PDB top to bottom order matches
the shift, but the residue number is all jumbled. So just take the
residue order in the PDB relatively, rather than the number column.

DB26874 is too corrupted, unusable for atom-level prediction.

DB26878  is too corrupted, unusable for atom-level prediction.

a-D-Kdop-(2-8)-a-D-Kdop-(2-4)-a-D-Kdop-(2-6)-b-D-GlcpN-(1-6)-a-D-GlcpN1PO4
the last residue in the PDB is PO3 and thus has no shifts, just note
that

b-D-Galp-(3-1)-a-D-Manp has the order flipped between PDB and csv,
(e.g. Manp is 2 in PDB and 1 in shift).

a-L-Rhap-(1-2)-b-D-Glcp1OMe has a 3rd residue in the PDB which is
basically the Me group, that corresponds to the "B-D-GLCP1OME  OMe
58.30 "   row in the C list in the shifts.

a-L-Rhap-(1-3)-b-D-Galp-(1-4)-b-D-GalpNAc-(3-1)-b-D-Galp residue 1 and
2 in the PDB are reversed, need to be flipped to match the csv.

a-D-Glcp-(1-3)-a-L-Galp and a-D-Glcp-(1-3)-b-L-Galp might have the
Glcp residues mislabeled, possibly should be GlcpA, just a note to
check later. When the residues end with A that makes it an acid and
those are more likely high C6 ppm

a-D-Apif is unusable, both the PDB and csv are super weird
